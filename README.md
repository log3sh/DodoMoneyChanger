A high-performance, mobile-first web application designed for **Dodo Money Changer**, a trusted automated licensed currency exchange service in Trichy. This project demonstrates a focus on **visual excellence**, **micro-interactions**, and **user-centric navigation**.

## 🚀 Innovation & Key Features

This isn't just a landing page; it's a polished user experience with several custom-tailored innovations:

### 📱 "Smart Scroll" Deep Linking (UX)
*   **Context-Aware Navigation**: The "Get Rates" CTA is engineered to bypass generic section headers. On mobile, it intelligently scrolls deeply past the map to land exactly on the **Phone & Address** details, ensuring the most critical user goal (calling/visiting) is immediate and unobstructed by sticky headers.
*   **Scroll Margin Logic**: Custom CSS architecture ensures anchor links land perfectly with precise offset calculations, accounting for the floating glass header.

### 🎨 Premium Glassmorphism UI
*   **Modern Aesthetic**: Built with a "Ditto" Light Theme using frosted glass effects (`backdrop-filter: blur`), organic gradients (`radial-gradient`), and subtle shadows.
*   **Micro-Animations**: Custom CSS animations for entry (fade-up), hover states (cards lifting), and interactive elements (pulse effects).
*   **Responsive Design**: A fluid layout that transforms from a multi-column desktop grid to a strictly stacked, centered mobile experience.

### ⚡ Performance First
*   **Zero-Bloat**: No heavy UI frameworks (Bootstrap/Tailwind). All styling is **Hand-Crafted Vanilla CSS** for maximum performance and pixel-perfect control.
*   **Native Feel**: Removal of default touch delays and custom cursors for touch devices to ensure the app feels like a native mobile experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with the latest cutting-edge web technologies:

*   **Core**: [React 19](https://react.dev/) - The latest standard in UI libraries.
*   **Build Tool**: [Vite 7](https://vitejs.dev/) - Lightning-fast HMR and bundling.
*   **Styling**: **Advanced CSS3** (Variables, Grid, Flexbox, Animations).
*   **Icons**: [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - Crisp, vector-based iconography.
*   **Deployment**: Vercel / Netlify ready.
